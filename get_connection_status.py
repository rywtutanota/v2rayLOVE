# This Python code sends a GET request to the URL "https://www.qq.com" with headers and a timeout of 1 second.
# It checks the response status code to determine if the request was successful or not, and sets the `internet_status` variable accordingly.
# If there was an error making the request, `internet_status` is set to "Failed✖".
# Finally, it prints the `internet_status` variable.

# The `requests` module is used for making HTTP requests in Python.
# The `headers` dictionary contains the headers to be sent with the request, which can help identify the client.
# The `timeout` parameter sets the maximum time to wait for a response from the server.

# The `try` and `except` blocks handle any exceptions that may occur during the request.
# If an exception occurs, `internet_status` is set to "Failed✖".
# Otherwise, the status code of the response is checked to determine the success of the request.
# The `print()` function is used to display the `internet_status` variable along with the string "Internet:".
# This code is useful for checking the status of the internet connection.
